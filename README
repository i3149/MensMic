MensMic -- Music for the Good Mind.

In Roman mythology, Mens, also known as Bona Mens or Mens Bona (Latin for "Good Mind"), was the 
personification of thought, consciousness and the mind, and also of "right-thinking". 
This project gives her a mic.

Running off of a NeuroSky MindWave EEG reader, MensMic turns your brainwaves into music.
